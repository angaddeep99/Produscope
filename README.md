Youtube is well-known for its vlogs, viral videos and product reviews.However, it’s also been increasingly used for e-learning.
User’s learning experience is hampered if ads come in between the video.
Proposed Solution: Youtube Focus
Users will have an option to earn coins:
At a cost
Promoting ad-videos on social media
Filling surveys
User can redeem these coins to disable ads for sometime.
Pricing of coins will be varying depending on geographical location.
We have left off the option for seeing accumulated ads in future due to its potential negative impact on revenue.
